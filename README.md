# Titanic_Pi
Code and logic use for developing and designing an auutomonous/RC robotic 8 foot model of the Titanic. Multiple Raspberry Pis will be used in the decision making, as well as using Arduinos for collecting data in the surrounding environment and sending it to the pis for analysis and to influence the ship's navigation or decision logic.
